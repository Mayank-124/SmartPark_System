# Smart Park System

Smart Parking makes use of sensing devices such as vehicle counting equipment, cameras, sensors installed in pavements, etc.
to discover occupancy of the parking lot. The strong sensing systems are being built to examine and transfer the data to the 
database in real time.

The system increases the accessibility of parking with the use of sensors. The sensors placed in the pavement of the selected
parking spaces to recognise if parking slot is occupied or vacant. Sensors communicates with gateway and that data will be push
to the cloud. Sensors then immediately show the availability of parking slots. This can be viewed on the Android APP or Website
so drives can easily identify the space and can book their slot for a particular time interval in advance.

I have utilised NodeMCU as a processor of our system along with MFRC522 RFID Card Reader and tags which works at 125KHz. A servo 
is there for showing us a locking mechanisim and a bunch of led's to show the status of the system. Further this project can be
enhanced by using a more sphisticated products like Solenoidal lock in place of servo or an OLED display in place of led's etc.

At last, I want to talk about Firebase which provides a real time database to test our products along with many usefull services 
like Web hosting, Data Science etc. 

Wanna See ? Have a look on the [Code]() and [Circuit Diagram]() !

Thank You !!
